## Research before starting project
### JS Framework
I chose Next.js because I love React and used Gatsby for 2 projects. I want to try Next.js.

### UI Library 
- Bootstrap: Cmon! It's always bootstrap.
- Bulma: Interesting.
- Semantic UI: Too simple, not graphically "flashy".
- Chakra: Seems interesting.
- Tailwind CSS: Already used in the last website. HTML too dirty.

### NextJS vs Gatsby
- I don't like file structure, there's no src folder.
